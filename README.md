# KMeansClustering-Python
 We implement KMeans clustering from scratch in python

This code was written as an assignment for a summer boot camp I attended at North Carolina State University, Raleigh.
I thought it was a good idea to publish this code as I had spent quite some time in documenting it; also the instructor seemed to like it as well.
